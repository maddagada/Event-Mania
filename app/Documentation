# MisUser Stories

1. As a wicked user, I would like to perform Denial of service attack to make the page unavailable to the legitimate user

    ###### Mitigation:

       Whitelisting/blacklisting the IP addresses
       
       Limiting the amount of traffic to a network interface controller
   
2. As a malicious user I want to execute malicious script through the browser, so I can hijack the user sessions by stealing their cookies and session tokens

    ###### Mitigation:

       By validating the user input, we can prevent the XSS attack. Input validation prevents user from adding special characters into the field.
       
       Cross-site scripting attack can be mitigated by sanitizing user input.

   
3. As a malicious hacker I would like to attack on the application using phishing techniques.

    ###### Mitigation:

       SPAM filters help in detecting the known viruses, blank senders.
       
       Updating systems frequently with the latest security versions and patches will reduce the chances of attack.


4. As a malicious attacker I want to perform malicious SQL statements against the database server, so I can get control over the database and perform CRUD operations.

    ###### Mitigation:

       Prepared statements with parametrized queries help in mitigating this attack 
   
       Applying the principle of least privilege security control help in minimizing the damage of attack.
